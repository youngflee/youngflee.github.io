Man, it's been a while since I've posted anything in this blog.    

To be honest, the reason I haven't been posting anything is a mix of forgetting I had this website in the first place, being busy with life, and not having anything to really talk about. I have resolved the first and third, but not exactly the second. That's a good thing, though, I guess - a boring life is not exactly an admirable one.        

Anyway, the good news is that I'll have material for the next few weeks, and probably much longer. The reason is that I've decided to start watching one movie every day! I got that idea from watching a lot of video essays from [Tony Zhou's Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting) and realizing I never make time to watch the movies I want to see. Then, I watched a couple of movies with my friend to compensate, and realized I wanted to keep watching them every day.    

So far, I have rewatched Spirited Away and Watership Down, and watched Millennium Actress and Paprika (from Japanese filmmaker Satoshi Kon). I'll give a quick rundown on what I think of all four of those. No spoilers here, so don't worry about anything - I'm not giving anything away, other than how good/mediocre/bad they are.    

__Spirited Away: 9.5/10__

If you have never watched Spirited Away, you seriously should. I could praise this movie until the cows come home. To summarize the plot, a girl's family is moving into town and stumble upon an abandoned amusement park. While exploring, the main character - Chihiro - and her parents get whisked into a strange spirit world. Her parents are turned into pigs by the witch that runs the nearby bathhouse, and Chihiro embarks on a journey to save them.    

The standout aspects of the movie are the excellent score, composed by Studio Ghibli regular Joe Hisaishi, and the animation, impeccable as most Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli films are. The animation reflects the kind of world Chihiro enters - almost childish, caricatured, and very beautiful.

I always liked the plot, but many people criticize the ending for being kind of a sputtering end rather than a smooth finish. I agree that it's a bit lackluster, but I still have always liked it. The ending really isn't that bad, and I just think the movie can't help but be liked in the end. The way the spirit world was portrayed as a fairy tale - topsy turvy, never to be questioned and never to be explained - just makes it all great.

__Watership Down: 7/10__

Based off the Richard Adams children's novel, this is a movie about a group of rabbits who discover their warren is in some sort of strange danger and venture off to find a new home. Like the novel, it's an allegory for government systems, which is apparent when you watch it and see the way various rabbit leaders are portrayed.

I remembered this movie better than it actually ended up being. When I first watched the movie, the most standout aspect of the story was the belief system presented through the introduction and the rabbits' dialogues. It seemed to make the whole movie, in my eyes, a Paulo Coelho The Alchemist-esque story of Hazel's journey in the world. After watching it again, it seemed much less so, and the movie itself seemed a lot less amazing after realizing that.    

Still, there are nice moments. The especially powerful ones, for me, are still the ones involving the Black Rabbit of Inlé, for example. I still love that eternal quote from Frith. "All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed."    

The animation itself is also pretty nice. I like the watercolor-like backgrounds that make every frame truly a painting. It's not as good as Spirited Away's animation, though.    

__Millennium Actress: 6.5/10__

__Paprika: 9/10__

Both Millennium Actress and Paprika were made by Satoshi Kon who is possibly the second most famous Japanese filmmaker, behind Miyazaki. Kon has made a particular style out of his [distinctive editing style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz49vQwSoTE), with very interesting cuts that warp both space and time until the movie ends up feeling like a Faulkner novel where you can't figure out where and when you even are. This is done through many, many match cuts, and they're actually super awesome. For details, watch the previously-linked-to video essay on Kon's work.    

The primary reason for this warping of space and time is that it suits the narrative Kon wishes to draw in his movies. As Tony describes in his video essay, Kon's films draws parallels between different identities in the characters' lives, whether that be onscreen-offscreen (Millennium Actress) or waking-dreaming (Paprika), and match cuts quickly draw you between the two worlds portrayed.

The strangest thing about the two movies is that after you get about 30 minutes or so into the movie, it starts getting incredibly difficult to figure out exactly which world you're in. It's not just the cuts that switch between time, but some of the dialogue seems like it's happening in a different world than the cut brought you to. I made the mistake of trying really hard to just piece together what exactly was going on in the plot. But once you stop trying to figure it out and let the narrative unfold, you can truly appreciate the movie. That's what I've found, anyway. The conclusion of the films always answer those questions on what exactly happened altogether throughout the film, so it all makes sense in the end.    

Anyway, let's talk about the specifics on the movies. I watched Millennium Actress first. The frame story is an old actress being interviewed after a keepsake of hers, a small key, was found at a torn-down movie studio. The actress takes the interviewers on her life story that is told switching between the stories of the films she acted in and her chase for her true love, an anti-government rebel she bumped into by chance on the street. The rebel gave her the key and told her they'd meet again. As mentioned before, the way the story is crafted blends the two stories together until they feel like one. It was good, but so much of the narrative was fueled by melodramatic Japanese period dramas. Obviously, that was the feel the movie was going for, considering it was following an actress from those films, but it just got so tiring and felt full of exhausted, clichéd banalities. It just ended up feeling almost uncomfortably silly at many places in the plot. The third act of the movie made up for it, but the story still had major issues.

Then, I watched Paprika, which is a whole other monster. Scientists working with a device that allows people to access other people's dreams find that a prototype has been stolen, and the thief is wreaking havoc upon the minds of innocent people. The device has even managed to make it into the minds of waking people, causing quite a bit of chaos. The scientists try to make things right, but are continuously sucked into dreams they can't get out of. At some point, the whole movie feels like one big dream, which is (for multiple reasons) absolutely terrifying and incredible to watch. (see the earlier gif) The story and execution was all incredible, and while I think the way Kon blends everything that's in the plot into one big cacophony of realities isn't exactly perfect for storytelling, it's certainly well done, and much better than in Millennium Actress. A must see, in my opinion.    

So that's my thoughts on the movies I watched these past few days. If you're interested in the movies I'm watching next:    

1. Princess Mononoke
2. The Big Lebowski
3. <s>2001: A Space Odyssey</s> JK, Drive (as of March 4th)
4. Upstream Color (by Shane Carruth who made Primer)
5. <s>The Green Mile</s> JK, Apocalypse Now (as of March 5th)
6. The Third Man
7. Goldfinger
8. The Bad Sleep Well (a Kurosawa film)

So that's what I'll be talking about in my next blog. See you all then!
