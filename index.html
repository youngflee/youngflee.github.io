    <div class="header"><i>About</i></div>
      <p>Hey, I'm Young Fenimore Lee (they/them). I went to high school in the north Chicagoland suburbs, graduated from Stanford studying English in 2021, and completed a poetry MFA at The New School in NYC in May 2023. I'm currently a PhD student in English at Ohio University in Athens, OH.<br /><br />
      I founded an indie music publication called <a href="https://jellybones.net">Jellybones</a> that aimed to amplify unheard voices and introduce people to undiscovered music from people of marginalized origin. I spent (and still spend) a lot of time going through self-released music on bandcamp, small labels, and whatever else pops up in my daily life of digging through the internet.<br /><br />
      Some latest publications or articles I am proud of:
