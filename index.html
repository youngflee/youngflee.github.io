      <p>
      Hey, I'm Young Fenimore Lee. I attend Adlai E. Stevenson High School as a sophomore in Lincolnshire, Illinois.<br /><br />
      I attend hackathons, and am a proud hackathon hacker <a href="https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601"> (no, not that kind of hacker)</a>. I tend to build a variety of things. Previous work includes a chrome extension and this website. A web app and an iOS app is in the works. I also am a graphics and web designer. I like to design logos, banners, and web pages. <a href="/in_progress.html">Check out some of my work from hackathons, designs, websites, and more.</a><br /><br />
      I run the Philosophy and Ethics Bowl club at SHS, and am an avid philosophy student and writer. I participate in the <a href="http://precollegephilosophy.blogspot.com/">American Philosophy Olympiad</a>, the United States olympiad for qualifying for the <a href="http://www.philosophy-olympiad.org/">International Philosophy Olympiad</a>. I also write literary fiction and creative writing. <a href="/in_progress.html">Check out some of my work in philosophy and literature.</a><br /><br />
      I write a blog, with topics such as design, personal philosophy, literature, and hacking. <a href="/blogs.html">Check it out here.</a><br /><br />
      I am free for freelance web and graphics design. I am also a prospective intern at any company for software development and maintenence (learning quickly is a virtue of mine, after all). <a href="/in_progress.html">Get in touch with me, and let's talk!</a>
