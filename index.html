    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
      Hey, I'm Young Fenimore Lee. I attend <a href="https://d125.org">Adlai E. Stevenson High School</a> in Lincolnshire, Illinois.<br /><br />
      <!-- I attend hackathons, and am a proud hackathon hacker <a href="https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601"> (no, not that kind of hacker)</a>. I tend to build a variety of things. Previous work includes a chrome extension and this website. A web app and an iOS app is in the works. I also am a graphics and web designer. I like to design logos, banners, and web pages. <a href="/in_progress.html">Check out some of my work from hackathons, designs, websites, and more.</a><br /><br /> 
      I run the Ethics Bowl team at SHS, and am an avid philosophy student and writer. I plan to participate in the <a href="http://precollegephilosophy.blogspot.com/">American Philosophy Olympiad</a>, the United States olympiad for qualifying for the <a href="http://www.philosophy-olympiad.org/">International Philosophy Olympiad</a>. I also write literary fiction and creative writing. <a href="/in_progress.html">Check out some of my work in philosophy and literature.</a><br /><br />
      I write a blog, with topics such as design, personal philosophy, literature, and hacking. <a href="/blogs.html">Check it out here.</a><br /><br />
      I am free for freelance web and graphics design. I am also a prospective intern at any company for software development and maintenence (learning quickly is a virtue of mine, after all). <a href="/in_progress.html">Get in touch with me, and let's talk!</a> -->
      I run my school's Ethics Bowl club and team at SHS, where we frame moral dilemmas through either hypothetical or real scenarios embedded in case studies. I run the club alongside the illustrious and glorious <a href="http://www2.d125.org/~nduba/">Mr. Clayton Duba</a>. We also read philosophical works of fiction as a fun aside, such as <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> I plan on us reading <i>No Exit</i> and some other Jean-Paul Sartre plays, too, (I recommend The Respectful Prostitute for existential philosophy with a side order of a glaring critique of American racism) since he is possibly one of my favorite philosophers. Aside from, of course, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/">John Rawls</a>. On the topic of philosophy, I'm an avid philosophy student, and plan to participate in next year's <a href="http://precollegephilosophy.blogspot.com/">American Philosophy Olympiad</a>, the United States olympiad for qualifying for the <a href="http://www.philosophy-olympiad.org/">International Philosophy Olympiad</a>. Hopefully, I'll get a lot of opportunities to talk about <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> in my essays.<br /><br />
      Speaking of Camus, I was introduced to a lot of philosophy through my other major passion, <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/">quizbowl</a>. I play on the SHS quizbowl team alongside brilliant generalist <a href="http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/view/Ali_Saeed">Ali Saeed</a>, history aficionados Kazuma Shiminaka and Marco Laudati, and Fine Arts specialist Nathan Cha. I am personally responsible for studying RMP (Religion, Mythology, Philosophy), Fine Arts (mainly concerning classical music, jazz history, art history, and architecture), and whatever else I can manage to study. Our team is ranked 18th on this year's <a href="http://hsqbrank.com/2016/01/08/top-200-high-school-teams-172016/">HS QB Rank</a>, and we hope to do well at this year's national level competitions (NSC in Chicago, Illinois and HSNCT in Dallas, Texas) in May and July.<br /><br />
      I solve Rubik's Cubes competitively at <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">World Cube Association</a> sanctioned competitions in the midwest region. I'm <a href="https://youngflee.github.io/cube_stats.html">decent</a>, with an  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg84fTpfke-b3xAWRdJQg4w">11 second unofficial 3x3 average</a> and a much worse in-competition average. I also have a 2x2 average of around 4 seconds, and average around 2 minutes for solving a 3x3 blindfolded.<br /><br />
      Other of my interests include attending hackathons like MHacks and Codeday, playing the clarinet in my school's Honor Band, and playing the cello in the <a href="http://cyso.org">Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra</a>. So yeah, that's me. I also have a <a href="blogs.html">blog</a>, where I talk about my personal philosophy of life, along with other stuff. Contact me through the links at the bottom of the page if you want/need to, for whatever reason, and thanks for taking a look around.
