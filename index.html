    <div class="header"><i>About</i></div>
      <p>Hey, I'm Young Fenimore Lee. I went to high school in the north Chicagoland suburbs, and I'm now an <strike>art history</strike> English student at Stanford, where I'll be graduating in June of 2021.<br /><br />
      My primary project is the indie music journalism publication I founded, <a href="https://jellybones.net">Jellybones</a>. We aim to amplify unheard voices and introduce people to undiscovered music from people of color, those who identify as queer and/or non-cis-male, and those from lower-class backgrounds. I spend a lot of time going through self-released music on bandcamp, small labels, and whatever else pops up in my daily life of digging through the internet.<br /><br />
      I'm a freelance music journalist currently writing for <a href="https://floodmagazine.com/">FLOOD Magizine</a> (I'm not exactly sure why it's in all caps) and some other places (ssshhh). I'm working on a book of essays on albums by artists from underrepresented backgrounds that find success through the internet music scene. Other interests include <a href="/blogs.html">writing</a>, playing electric guitar, and producing music. Feel free to read around, and thanks for taking a look around.<br /><br />
