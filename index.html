    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hey, I'm Young Fenimore Lee. I went to high school in the north Chicagoland suburbs., and I'm now an art history student at Stanford, where I'll be graduating in June of 2021.<br /><br />
      My primary area of research is contemporary asian art. I really enjoy installation artists who use video in their works, such as Zhang Peili and Nam June Paik. I'm currently working on some research on the Korean internet art duo <a href="http://www.yhchang.com/">Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries</a>, whose entire present and future archive has been acquired by <a href="https://www.artsy.net/news/artsy-editorial-hong-kongs-m-museum-acquired-internet-art-duos-entire-archive-rights-future-works">M+ in Hong Kong</a>, and I"m hoping to head over to Hong Kong when M+ opens to work with their archive of all of their installation works.<br /><br />
      I spend a lot of time writing questions for <a href="https://www.naqt.com/nationals/press-guide.jsp">quizbowl</a>. I'm a member of a national association for high school quizbowl called <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/about/">PACE</a>, and I'm currently a subject editor for collegiate quizbowl's premier introductory tournament, ACF Fall. I've worked on <a href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=20424">some</a> <a href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=20808">other</a> yearly sets, and really enjoy working with other writers to craft well-executed sets. I tend to write fine arts, religion, mythology, and philosophy, the categories that I focus on as a player, too.<br /><br />
      I solve Rubik's Cubes competitively at <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">World Cube Association</a> sanctioned competitions in the midwest + bay area. I have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm7PRGvxeNY">9.900 second unofficial 3x3 average</a> and a <a href="https://youngflee.github.io/cube_stats.html">somewhat worse official competition average</a>. The events I care about the most are 3x3, 3x3 one handed (I average just about 20 seconds), 3x3 blindfolded (I average just under 2 minutes or something), and 3x3 multi-blind (memorize however many cubes you want all at once and solve them all blindfolded).<br /><br />
      Other interests include attending hackathons, like MHacks and Codeday, and playing jazz in some small ensembles with friends. I also have a <a href="blogs.html">blog</a>, where I put up some writing and thoughts on whatever's going on at the moment (a lot of it is miscellanious stuff from high school). (Note: <a href=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/superlative.png>I am literally this guy</a>) Contact me through the links at the bottom of the page if you want/need to, for whatever reason, and thanks for taking a look around.<br /><br />
