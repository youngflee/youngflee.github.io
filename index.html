    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hey, I'm Young Fenimore Lee. I attend high school in the north Chicagoland suburbs.<br /><br />
      I run my school's Ethics Bowl club and team at SHS, where we frame moral dilemmas through either hypothetical or real scenarios embedded in case studies. I run the club alongside the illustrious and glorious <a href="http://www2.d125.org/~nduba/">Mr. Clayton Duba</a>. We also read philosophical works of fiction as a fun aside, such as <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> I plan on us reading <i>No Exit</i> and some other Jean-Paul Sartre plays, too, (I recommend The Respectful Prostitute for existential philosophy with a side order of a glaring critique of American racism) since he is possibly one of my favorite philosophers. Aside from, of course, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/">John Rawls</a>. Aside from Ethics Bowl, I plan to participate in next year's <a href="http://precollegephilosophy.blogspot.com/">American Philosophy Olympiad</a>, the United States olympiad for qualifying for the <a href="http://www.philosophy-olympiad.org/">International Philosophy Olympiad</a>.<br /> <br />
      I was actually introduced to a lot of philosophy through my other major passion, <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/what-is-quizbowl-a-primer-and-faq-for-newcomers/">quizbowl</a>. I play on the <a href="https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/view/Stevenson">Stevenson quizbowl team</a> alongside brilliant generalist <a href="http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/view/Ali_Saeed">Ali Saeed</a>, history aficionados <del>Kazuma Shiminaka and Marco Laudati</del> Govind Prabhakar and Conrad Oberhaus, and Fine Arts specialist Nathan Cha. I am personally responsible for studying RMP (Religion, Mythology, Philosophy), Fine Arts (mainly concerning classical music, jazz history, art history, and architecture), and whatever else I can manage to study. At the 2016 nationals, we finished T-13 at <a href="https://www.naqt.com/stats/tournament-teams.jsp?tournament_id=6600">NAQT's High School National Championship Tournament</a> and 2nd place at <a href=http://www.hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/3766/stats/all_games/>PACE National Scholastic Championship</a>. Our team is ranked 10th on this year's <a href="https://hsqbrank.com/2016/08/22/2016-17-preseason-rankings/">national pre-season HS QB Rank</a>, and we hope to do just as well this coming season as we did last year.<br /><br />
      I solve Rubik's Cubes competitively at <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">World Cube Association</a> sanctioned competitions in the midwest region. I have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lNuMKLqXOg">11 second unofficial 3x3 average</a> and an <a href="https://youngflee.github.io/cube_stats.html">official competition average somewhere around there</a>. The events I care about the most are 3x3, 3x3 one handed (I average just about 20 seconds), and 3x3 blindfolded (I average just under 2 minutes).<br /><br />
      Other interests include attending hackathons like MHacks and Codeday, playing jazz on alto sax and clarinet, and playing the cello in the <a href="http://cyso.org">Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra</a>. I also have a <a href="blogs.html">blog</a>, where I talk about my thoughts on whatever I'm thinking about at the moment. Contact me through the links at the bottom of the page if you want/need to, for whatever reason, and thanks for taking a look around.
