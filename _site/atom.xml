&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;01 Mar 2015 - Buffalo Grove, Illinois - 21:04&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, it’s been a while since I’ve posted anything in this blog.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the reason I haven’t been posting anything is a mix of forgetting I had this website in the first place, being busy with life, and not having anything to really talk about. I have resolved the first and third, but not exactly the second. That’s a good thing, though, I guess - a boring life is not exactly an admirable one.        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the good news is that I’ll have material for the next few weeks, and probably much longer. The reason is that I’ve decided to start watching one movie every day! I got that idea from watching a lot of video essays from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting&quot;&gt;Tony Zhou’s Every Frame a Painting&lt;/a&gt; and realizing I never make time to watch the movies I want to see. Then, I watched a couple of movies with my friend to compensate, and realized I wanted to keep watching them every day.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have rewatched Spirited Away and Watership Down, and watched Millennium Actress and Paprika (from Japanese filmmaker Satoshi Kon). I’ll give a quick rundown on what I think of all four of those. No spoilers here, so don’t worry about anything - I’m not giving anything away, other than how good/mediocre/bad they are.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirited Away: 4.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have never watched Spirited Away, you seriously should. I could praise this movie until the cows come home. To summarize the plot, a girl’s family is moving into town and stumble upon an abandoned amusement park. While exploring, the main character - Chihiro - and her parents get whisked into a strange spirit world. Her parents are turned into pigs by the witch that runs the nearby bathhouse, and Chihiro embarks on a journey to save them.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standout aspects of the movie are the excellent score, composed by Studio Ghibli regular Joe Hisaishi, and the animation, impeccable as most Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli films are. The animation reflects the kind of world Chihiro enters - almost childish, caricatured, and very beautiful.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/spirited-away.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spirited Away&quot; style=&quot;width: 35em; margin: 1em 7.5em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always liked the plot, but many people criticize the ending for being kind of a sputtering end rather than a smooth finish. I agree that it’s a bit lackluster, but I still have always liked it. The ending really isn’t that bad, and I just think the movie can’t help but be liked in the end. The way the spirit world was portrayed as a fairy tale - topsy turvy, never to be questioned and never to be explained - just makes it all great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watership Down: 3.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based off the Richard Adams children’s novel, this is a movie about a group of rabbits who discover their warren is in some sort of strange danger and venture off to find a new home. Like the novel, it’s an allegory for government systems, which is apparent when you watch it and see the way various rabbit leaders are portrayed.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/watership-down.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Watership Down&quot; style=&quot;width: 35em; margin: 1em 7.5em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered this movie better than it actually ended up being. When I first watched the movie, the most standout aspect of the story was the belief system presented through the introduction and the rabbits’ dialogues. It seemed to make the whole movie, in my eyes, a Paulo Coelho The Alchemist-esque story of Hazel’s journey in the world. After watching it again, it seemed much less so, and the movie itself seemed a lot less amazing after realizing that.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are nice moments. The especially powerful ones, for me, are still the ones involving the Black Rabbit of Inlé, for example. I still love that eternal quote from Frith. “All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed.”    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation itself is also pretty nice. I like the watercolor-like backgrounds that make every frame truly a painting. It’s not as good as Spirited Away’s animation, though.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millennium Actress: 3.25/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paprika: 4.5/5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Millennium Actress and Paprika were made by Satoshi Kon who is possibly the second most famous Japanese filmmaker, behind Miyazaki. Kon has made a particular style out of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz49vQwSoTE&quot;&gt;distinctive editing style&lt;/a&gt;, with very interesting cuts that warp both space and time until the movie ends up feeling like a Faulkner novel where you can’t figure out where and when you even are. This is done through many, many match cuts, and they’re actually super awesome. For details, watch the previously-linked-to video essay on Kon’s work.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for this warping of space and time is that it suits the narrative Kon wishes to draw in his movies. As Tony describes in his video essay, Kon’s films draws parallels between different identities in the characters’ lives, whether that be onscreen-offscreen (Millennium Actress) or waking-dreaming (Paprika), and match cuts quickly draw you between the two worlds portrayed.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://otakufilms.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Paprika Fascinating Cut&quot; style=&quot;width: 35em; margin: 1em 7.5em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strangest thing about the two movies is that after you get about 30 minutes or so into the movie, it starts getting incredibly difficult to figure out exactly which world you’re in. It’s not just the cuts that switch between time, but some of the dialogue seems like it’s happening in a different world than the cut brought you to. I made the mistake of trying really hard to just piece together what exactly was going on in the plot. But once you stop trying to figure it out and let the narrative unfold, you can truly appreciate the movie. That’s what I’ve found, anyway. The conclusion of the films always answer those questions on what exactly happened altogether throughout the film, so it all makes sense in the end.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s talk about the specifics on the movies. I watched Millennium Actress first. The frame story is an old actress being interviewed after a keepsake of hers, a small key, was found at a torn-down movie studio. The actress takes the interviewers on her life story that is told switching between the stories of the films she acted in and her chase for her true love, an anti-government rebel she bumped into by chance on the street. The rebel gave her the key and told her they’d meet again. As mentioned before, the way the story is crafted blends the two stories together until they feel like one. It was good, but so much of the narrative was fueled by melodramatic Japanese period dramas. Obviously, that was the feel the movie was going for, considering it was following an actress from those films, but it just got so tiring and felt full of exhausted, clichéd banalities. It just ended up feeling almost uncomfortably silly at many places in the plot. The third act of the movie made up for it, but the story still had major issues.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/millennium-actress.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Millennium Actress&quot; style=&quot;width: 35em; margin: 1em 7.5em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I watched Paprika, which is a whole other monster. Scientists working with a device that allows people to access other people’s dreams find that a prototype has been stolen, and the thief is wreaking havoc upon the minds of innocent people. The device has even managed to make it into the minds of waking people, causing quite a bit of chaos. The scientists try to make things right, but are continuously sucked into dreams they can’t get out of. At some point, the whole movie feels like one big dream, which is (for multiple reasons) absolutely terrifying and incredible to watch. (see the earlier gif) The story and execution was all incredible, and while I think the way Kon blends everything that’s in the plot into one big cacophony of realities isn’t exactly perfect for storytelling, it’s certainly well done, and much better than in Millennium Actress. A must see, in my opinion.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s my thoughts on the movies I watched these past few days. If you’re interested in the movies I’m watching next:    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Princess Mononoke&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Big Lebowski&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upstream Color (by Shane Carruth who made Primer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Green Mile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Third Man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goldfinger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Bad Sleep Well (a Kurosawa film)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what I’ll be talking about in my next blog. See you all then, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Hopeful Epiphany</title>
    <link href="https://slinky773.github.io/2015/02/01/epiphany.html"/>
    <updated>2015-02-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-hopeful-epiphany&quot;&gt;A Hopeful Epiphany&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;01 Feb 2015 - Buffalo Grove, Illinois - 6:34 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, I had an epiphany. The epiphany was that I (myself, not anyone else) should live my life according to the maxim “live life for others.”    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the kind of philosopher that I hate the most - a romanticist philosopher. My thought is constantly driven by emotions, rather than rigorous logic. It’s natural for humans to be so, but in philosophy, this is a death sentence (in my opinion, anyway). How are you ever going to come up with logical reason if whatever reasoning you come up with is produced by emotion? Emotion will never be the origin of complete objectivity. Philosophy is supposed to be driven through complete objectivity. These things cannot coexist.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: these are my own opinions about what philosophy truly is. Not real philosophers. :P)    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, this maxim I produced was intended to be how all people should live. It was produced out of thin air, as I sat in my room, deep in sad thought. Nothing actually happened recently, but I was feeling sorrowful. Obviously a product of my adolescent mind, wired to go haywire in mood constantly. It was in this mood that I thought about the prospect of people living their lives for others. I then formed the statement you saw above as a categorical imperative - my own version of Kant’s universal laws.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So obviously, not exactly an objectively great categorical imperative. But my process for creating my own philosophy is to produce these statements and analyze them with a reasoned mind. After all, it might actually be well reasoned (somehow).    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I haven’t turned into a purely logical mind is because that romanticist part of my brain is absolutely necessary to stay human. If I decided to make myself act in purely logical ways, I’m certain I would begin to devolve. I would lose any sense of personality. My peers would quickly begin to hate me.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romanticism is who I am as a human. Philosophy is who I am beyond that.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after analyzing what I came up with this time, I decided that it should truly be called a maxim because I decided it shouldn’t apply to anyone other than myself. It seems to only be a good way to live for myself. And here’s my reasoning:    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have grown up, I have developed into a person who essentially lives for the approval of others. It’s something innate, and I don’t think I could change that, nor would I want to. It has come to define who I am. I essentially derive pleasure in life from company and approval from others.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this has come to mean that basically, I love to brag about myself. I enjoy the pointless tauting of accomplishments that, in the eyes of the uninitiated, are impressive, and in the eyes of the knowledgeable, are not even close to impressive. It has become a selfish and pointless thing, to live to impress others. It has led to nearly no direction in life. Even if impressing people made me happy, it seemed like there really wasn’t a point to it all.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse was the fact that since I have never innately cared about doing things for myself, for purely self satisfaction, I really never did anything at all. Sure, I care about eating, and sleeping (sometimes), but when it came to ambition, I have never really been able to be satisfied through myself. It was all just for bragging - the only satisfaction I gained was when others approved of it. After finishing something on my own, without evaluation from others, I innately solely worry about what others think of it. Is it according to others’ standards? Is this truly good? Or am I just in over my head? And after I realized how pointless it was to live in that way, without a direction, eventually I just did nothing at all.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has to be a different way of living, right?    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m never going to be able to change my habit of needing social interaction and approval to be happy. At least, I shouldn’t count on it. It’s very well ingrained inside of me - so far ingrained that I have doubts about whether I can change it. And I’m sure that even if I was able to, if I tried to change myself so drastically, it would be damaging to myself.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not embrace this habit of instinct? Why not change my mindset about what I do to take advantage of the fact that I naturally gravitate towards other people?    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what my new maxim is. It’s me embracing that mindset and even making it into something noble. Now, whenever I think about what I am doing, I think about everything in terms of benefitting others, not myself. It’s what I have always wanted to do, anyway - break off the pointlessness of the past and care solely about others. And that’s not altruistic or godly - it’s human. For me, anyway. That’s just how I am.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others aren’t. That’s okay. Don’t live like I do if you don’t want to, or can’t. This is just how I have decided to do things.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New Year's Resolution</title>
    <link href="https://slinky773.github.io/2015/01/01/new-year.html"/>
    <updated>2015-01-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://slinky773.github.io/2015/01/01/new-year</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-new-years-resolution&quot;&gt;The New Year’s Resolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;01 Jan 2015 - Buffalo Grove, Illinois - 2:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think of new year’s day, I think of a lot of broken promises. Every year, people systematically make promises and break them. They say that they will quit smoking this year. That they will stop drinking this year. Eat healthier. Start going to the gym. Stop procrastinating. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most people, this seems to go on &lt;em&gt;ad infinitum&lt;/em&gt;. The same promises are made year after year. People remember the resolution they made last year and resolve to truly realize their goals &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; year. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; year, things will be different. After all, things &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to improve some time, right?    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Things never &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to change. You can easily stay the same for your entire life, so long as no one has to care about you.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take the example of the neurotic alcoholic. You may never be forced to actually stop drinking. Unless you’re such a drunk that you cause car accidents and mayhem everywhere, you could just be left to yourself in an apartment by yourself for your entire life, abandoned by your family because you couldn’t stop ruining the lives of your loved ones. They wouldn’t have to care about you. After that, unless you ruin the lives of everyone else in your proximity, no one has to care.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is strictly hypothetical, but the point is that it’s a very real possibility that &lt;strong&gt;no one cares about you&lt;/strong&gt;. So who’s going to do it? Who’s going to make you change?    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is the only one who is guaranteed to care so much about you as to make you change. Yep. You.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re the person who, like me, resolves the same time of every year to change the same flaws, realize (as I just did) that unless you really decide to change, things never will.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, do not take this to mean that things will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; change. Things don’t have to change, but that doesn’t mean they can’t. You can change them.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just don’t expect things to happen by themselves.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have realized this just recently. My goal - of getting my &lt;em&gt;shit together&lt;/em&gt; and actually taking things seriously - has been a work in progress over the past several years of my life. I continue to prioritize what I think is important over what is actually important. I continue to prioritize my friends, online forums, and coding projects over my schoolwork and academics. I obviously realize the importance of the latter, but have yet to figure out how I will eventually force myself to take them more seriously.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next year is the year I make myself change. Not because change is inevitable, but because change is &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not impossible to change.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not impossible to change.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not impossible.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
